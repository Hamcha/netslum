netslum is a telnet interface to @aliceffekt's Paradise (paradise.xxiivv.com)

             .:..vim [optio'.: live demo :.-..it pus.o32i:..

                     netslum.padrepio.in @ port 8484

If you have linux/OS X/*BSD, just "nc netslum.padrepio.in 8484"
If you have Windows, use PuTTy! Set to "Telnet" and then change port.

If the server crashed for some reason, ping me on Twitter (@hamcha) or here!

Inspired by .hack// saga, where Net Slum is (and isn't, at the same time) part
of The World, and it's referred as "Paradise" by Helba.

Also no, I'm not using Heartbleed ram dumps as fancy delimiters.
That'd be awesome though.
