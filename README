netslum is a telnet interface to @aliceffekt's Paradise (paradise.xxiivv.com)

              .:..vim [optio'~/.zsh34kv-.o-..it pus.o32i:.

At the moment of writing the server doesn't work, I'm working on it.

When basic functionality will be implemented, expect a server to pop up at
netslum.padrepio.in @ port 8484

              ..:,.o'.tc/rc.d/ng.o:.35df-h_|grep..@512M:..

Inspired by .hack// saga, where Net Slum is (and isn't, at the same time) part
of The World, and it's referred as "Paradise" by Helba.

Also no, I'm not using Heartbleed ram dumps as fancy delimiters.
That'd be awesome though.
